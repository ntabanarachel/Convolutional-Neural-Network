Convolutional Neural Networks

• Convolution is a mathematical term to describe the process of
combining two functions to produce a third function
• This third function or the output is called a Feature Map
• A convolution is the action of using a filter or kernel that is applied to
the input. In our case, the input being our input image.
• Convolutions are executed by sliding the filter or kernel over the input
image.
• This sliding process is a simple matrix multiplication or dot product.
